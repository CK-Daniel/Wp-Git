Introduction
This article describes how to quickly get started with the GitHub REST API using GitHub CLI, curl, or JavaScript. For a more detailed guide, see Getting started with the REST API.

Using curl in the command line
Note

If you want to make API requests from the command line, GitHub recommends that you use GitHub CLI, which simplifies authentication and requests. For more information about getting started with the REST API using GitHub CLI, see the GitHub CLI version of this article.

Install curl if it isn't already installed on your machine. To check if curl is installed, execute curl --version in the command line. If the output provides information about the version of curl, that means curl is installed. If you get a message similar to command not found: curl, you need to download and install curl. For more information, see the curl project download page.

Create an access token. For example, create a personal access token or a GitHub App user access token. You will use this token to authenticate your request, so you should give it any scopes or permissions that are required to access the endpoint. For more information, see Authenticating to the REST API.

Warning

Treat your access token like a password.

To keep your token secure, you can store your token as a Codespaces secret and use the command line through Codespaces. For more information, see Managing encrypted secrets for your codespaces.

You can also use GitHub CLI instead of curl. GitHub CLI will take care of authentication for you. For more information, see the GitHub CLI version of this page.

If these options are not possible, consider using another CLI service to store your token securely.

Use the curl command to make your request. Pass your token in an Authorization header. Replace YOUR-TOKEN with your token.

Shell
curl --request GET \
--url "https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Spoon-Knife/issues" \
--header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN"
Note

In most cases, you can use Authorization: Bearer or Authorization: token to pass a token. However, if you are passing a JSON web token (JWT), you must use Authorization: Bearer.

Using curl commands in GitHub Actions
You can also use curl commands in your GitHub Actions workflows.

Authenticating with an access token
GitHub recommends that you use the built-in GITHUB_TOKEN instead of creating a token. If this is not possible, store your token as a secret and replace GITHUB_TOKEN in the example below with the name of your secret. For more information about GITHUB_TOKEN, see Automatic token authentication. For more information about secrets, see Using secrets in GitHub Actions.

YAML
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  use_api:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: read
    steps:
      - env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          curl --request GET \
          --url "https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Spoon-Knife/issues" \
          --header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
          --header "Authorization: Bearer $GH_TOKEN"
Authenticating with a GitHub App
If you are authenticating with a GitHub App, you can create an installation access token within your workflow:

Store your GitHub App's ID as a configuration variable. In the following example, replace APP_ID with the name of the configuration variable. You can find your app ID on the settings page for your app or through the App API. For more information, see REST API endpoints for GitHub Apps. For more information about configuration variables, see Store information in variables.

Generate a private key for your app. Store the contents of the resulting file as a secret. (Store the entire contents of the file, including -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- and -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----.) In the following example, replace APP_PEM with the name of the secret. For more information, see Managing private keys for GitHub Apps. For more information about storing secrets, see Using secrets in GitHub Actions.

Add a step to generate a token, and use that token instead of GITHUB_TOKEN. Note that this token will expire after 60 minutes. For example:

YAML
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  use_api:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Generate token
        id: generate-token
        uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v1
        with:
          app-id: ${{ vars.APP_ID }}
          private-key: ${{ secrets.APP_PEM }}

      - name: Use API
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ steps.generate-token.outputs.token }}
        run: |
          curl --request GET \
          --url "https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Spoon-Knife/issues" \
          --header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
          --header "Authorization: Bearer $GH_TOKEN"

Introduction
This article describes how to use the GitHub REST API with GitHub CLI, curl, or JavaScript. For a quickstart guide, see Quickstart for GitHub REST API.

About requests to the REST API
This section describes the elements that make up an API request:

HTTP method
Path
Headers
Media types
Authentication
Parameters
Every request to the REST API includes an HTTP method and a path. Depending on the REST API endpoint, you might also need to specify request headers, authentication information, query parameters, or body parameters.

The REST API reference documentation describes the HTTP method, path, and parameters for every endpoint. It also displays example requests and responses for each endpoint. For more information, see the REST reference documentation.

HTTP method
The HTTP method of an endpoint defines the type of action it performs on a given resource. Some common HTTP methods are GET, POST, DELETE, and PATCH. The REST API reference documentation provides the HTTP method for every endpoint.

For example, the HTTP method for the "List repository issues" endpoint is GET."

Where possible, the GitHub REST API strives to use an appropriate HTTP method for each action.

GET: Used for retrieving resources.
POST: Used for creating resources.
PATCH: Used for updating properties of resources.
PUT: Used for replacing resources or collections of resources.
DELETE: Used for deleting resources.
Path
Each endpoint has a path. The REST API reference documentation gives the path for every endpoint. For example, the path for the "List repository issues" endpoint is /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues.

The curly brackets {} in a path denote path parameters that you need to specify. Path parameters modify the endpoint path and are required in your request. For example, the path parameters for the "List repository issues" endpoint are {owner} and {repo}. To use this path in your API request, replace {repo} with the name of the repository where you would like to request a list of issues, and replace {owner} with the name of the account that owns the repository.

Headers
Headers provide extra information about the request and the desired response. Following are some examples of headers that you can use in your requests to the GitHub REST API. For an example of a request that uses headers, see Making a request.

Accept
Most GitHub REST API endpoints specify that you should pass an Accept header with a value of application/vnd.github+json. The value of the Accept header is a media type. For more information about media types, see Media types.

X-GitHub-Api-Version
You should use this header to specify a version of the REST API to use for your request. For more information, see API Versions.

User-Agent
All API requests must include a valid User-Agent header. The User-Agent header identifies the user or application that is making the request.

By default, curl sends a valid User-Agent header. However GitHub recommends using your GitHub username, or the name of your application, for the User-Agent header value. This allows GitHub to contact you if there are problems.

The following is an example User-Agent for an app named Awesome-Octocat-App:

User-Agent: Awesome-Octocat-App
Requests with no User-Agent header will be rejected. If you provide an invalid User-Agent header, you will receive a 403 Forbidden response.


Media types
You can specify one or more media types by adding them to the Accept header of your request. For more information about the Accept header, see Accept.

Media types specify the format of the data you want to consume from the API. Media types are specific to resources, allowing them to change independently and support formats that other resources don't. The documentation for each GitHub REST API endpoint will describe the media types that it supports. For more information, see the GitHub REST API documentation.

The most common media types supported by the GitHub REST API are application/vnd.github+json and application/json.

There are custom media types that you can use with some endpoints. For example, the REST API to manage commits and pull requests support the media types diff, patch, and sha. The media types full, raw, text, or html are used by some other endpoints.

All custom media types for GitHub look like this: application/vnd.github.PARAM+json, where PARAM is the name of the media type. For example, to specify the raw media type, you would use application/vnd.github.raw+json.

For an example of a request that uses media types, see Making a request.

Authentication
Many endpoints require authentication or return additional information if you are authenticated. Additionally, you can make more requests per hour when you are authenticated.

To authenticate your request, you will need to provide an authentication token with the required scopes or permissions. There a few different ways to get a token: You can create a personal access token, generate a token with a GitHub App, or use the built-in GITHUB_TOKEN in a GitHub Actions workflow. For more information, see Authenticating to the REST API.

For an example of a request that uses an authentication token, see Making a request.

Note

If you don't want to create a token, you can use GitHub CLI. GitHub CLI will take care of authentication for you, and help keep your account secure. For more information, see the GitHub CLI version of this page.

Warning

Treat your access token the same way you would treat your passwords or other sensitive credentials. For more information, see Keeping your API credentials secure.

Parameters
Many API methods require or allow you to send additional information in parameters in your request. There are a few different types of parameters: Path parameters, body parameters, and query parameters.

Path parameters
Path parameters modify the endpoint path. These parameters are required in your request. For more information, see Path.

Body parameters
Body parameters allow you to pass additional data to the API. These parameters can be optional or required, depending on the endpoint. For example, a body parameter may allow you to specify an issue title when creating a new issue, or specify certain settings when enabling or disabling a feature. The documentation for each GitHub REST API endpoint will describe the body parameters that it supports. For more information, see the GitHub REST API documentation.

For example, the "Create an issue" endpoint requires that you specify a title for the new issue in your request. It also allows you to optionally specify other information, such as text to put in the issue body, users to assign to the new issue, or labels to apply to the new issue. For an example of a request that uses body parameters, see Making a request.

You must authenticate your request to pass body parameters. For more information, see Authenticating.

Query parameters
Query parameters allow you to control what data is returned for a request. These parameters are usually optional. The documentation for each GitHub REST API endpoint will describe any query parameters that it supports. For more information, see the GitHub REST API documentation.

For example, the "List public events" endpoint returns thirty issues by default. You can use the per_page query parameter to return two issues instead of 30. You can use the page query parameter to fetch only the first page of results. For an example of a request that uses query parameters, see Making a request.

Making a request
This section demonstrates how to make an authenticated request to the GitHub REST API using curl.

1. Setup
You must have curl installed on your machine. To check if curl is already installed, run curl --version on the command line.

If the output provides information about the version of curl, that means curl is installed.
If you get a message similar to command not found: curl, that means curl is not installed. Download and install curl. For more information, see the curl download page.
2. Choose an endpoint for your request
Choose an endpoint to make a request to. You can explore GitHub's REST API documentation to discover endpoints that you can use to interact with GitHub.

Identify the HTTP method and path of the endpoint. You will send these with your request. For more information, see HTTP method and Path.

For example, the "Create an issue" endpoint uses the HTTP method POST and the path /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues.

Identify any required path parameters. Required path parameters appear in curly brackets {} in the path of the endpoint. Replace each parameter placeholder with the desired value. For more information, see Path.

For example, the "Create an issue" endpoint uses the path /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues, and the path parameters are {owner} and {repo}. To use this path in your API request, replace {repo} with the name of the repository where you would like to create a new issue, and replace {owner} with the name of the account that owns the repository.

3. Create authentication credentials
Create an access token to authenticate your request. You can save your token and use it for multiple requests. Give the token any scopes or permissions that are required to access the endpoint. You will send this token in an Authorization header with your request. For more information, see Authentication.

4. Make a curl request
Use the curl command to make your request. For more information, see the curl documentation.

Specify the following options and values in your request:

--request or -X followed by the HTTP method as the value. For more information, see HTTP method.

--url followed by the full path as the value. The full path is a URL that includes the base URL for the GitHub REST API (https://api.github.com) and the path of the endpoint, like this: https://api.github.com/PATH. Replace PATH with the path of the endpoint. For more information, see Path.

To use query parameters, add a ? to the end of the path, then append your query parameter name and value in the form parameter_name=value. Separate multiple query parameters with &. If you need to send an array in the query string, use the query parameter once per array item, and append [] after the query parameter name. For example, to provide an array of two repository IDs, use ?repository_ids[]=REPOSITORY_A_ID&repository_ids[]=REPOSITORY_B_ID. For more information, see Query parameters. For an example, see Example request using query parameters.

--header or -H:

Accept: Pass the media type in an Accept header. To pass multiple media types in an Accept header, separate the media types with a comma, for example: Accept: application/vnd.github+json,application/vnd.github.diff. For more information, see Accept and Media types.
X-GitHub-Api-Version: Pass the API version in a X-GitHub-Api-Version header. For more information, see X-GitHub-Api-Version.
Authorization: Pass your authentication token in an Authorization header. Note that in most cases you can use Authorization: Bearer or Authorization: token to pass a token. However, if you are passing a JSON web token (JWT), you must use Authorization: Bearer. For more information, see Authentication. For an example of a request that uses an Authorization header, see Example request using body parameters.
--data or -d followed by any body parameters within a JSON object. If you do not need to specify any body parameters in your request, omit this option. For more information, see Body parameters. For an example, see Example request using body parameters.

Example request
The following example request uses the "Get Octocat" endpoint to return the octocat as ASCII art.

Shell
curl --request GET \
--url "https://api.github.com/octocat" \
--header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
--header "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28"
Example request using query parameters
The "List public events" endpoint returns thirty issues by default. The following example uses the per_page query parameter to return two issues instead of 30, and the page query parameter to fetch only the first page of results.

Shell
curl --request GET \
--url "https://api.github.com/events?per_page=2&page=1" \
--header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
--header "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  https://api.github.com/events
Example request using body parameters
The following example uses the Create an issue endpoint to create a new issue in the octocat/Spoon-Knife repository. Replace YOUR-TOKEN with the authentication token you created in a previous step.

Note

If you are using a fine-grained personal access token, you must replace octocat/Spoon-Knife with a repository that you own or that is owned by an organization that you are a member of. Your token must have access to that repository and have read and write permissions for repository issues. For more information, see Managing your personal access tokens.

Shell
curl \
--request POST \
--url "https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Spoon-Knife/issues" \
--header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
--header "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN" \
--data '{
  "title": "Created with the REST API",
  "body": "This is a test issue created by the REST API"
}'
Using the response
After you make a request, the API will return the response status code, response headers, and potentially a response body.

About the response code and headers
Every request will return an HTTP status code that indicates the success of the response. For more information about response codes, see the MDN HTTP response status code documentation.

Additionally, the response will include headers that give more details about the response. Headers that start with X- or x- are custom to GitHub. For example, the x-ratelimit-remaining and x-ratelimit-reset headers tell you how many requests you can make in a time period.

To view the status code and headers, use the --include or --i option when you send your request.

For example, this request gets a list of issues in the octocat/Spoon-Knife repository:

curl --request GET \
--url "https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Spoon-Knife/issues?per_page=2" \
--header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN" \
--include
And it returns a response code and headers that look something like this:

HTTP/2 200
server: GitHub.com

accept-ranges: bytes
content-length: 4936
x-github-request-id: 14E0:4BC6:F1B8BA:208E317:62EC2715
In this example, the response code is 200, which indicates a successful request.

About the response body
Many endpoints will return a response body. Unless otherwise specified, the response body is in JSON format. Blank fields are included as null instead of being omitted. All timestamps return in UTC time, ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ.

Unlike the GraphQL API where you specify what information you want, the REST API typically returns more information than you need. If desired, you can parse the response to pull out specific pieces of information.

For example, you can use > to redirect the response to a file. In the following example, replace REPO-OWNER with the name of the account that owns the repository, and REPO-NAME with the name of the repository.

Shell
curl --request GET \
--url "https://api.github.com/repos/REPO-OWNER/REPO-NAME/issues?per_page=2" \
--header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN" > data.json
Then you can use jq to get the title and author ID of each issue:

Shell
jq '.[] | {title: .title, authorID: .user.id}' data.json
The previous two commands return something like:

{
  "title": "Update index.html",
  "authorID": 10701255
}
{
  "title": "Edit index file",
  "authorID": 53709285
}
For more information about jq, see the jq documentation.

Detailed versus summary representations
A response can include all attributes for a resource or only a subset of attributes, depending on whether you fetch an individual resource or a list of resources.

When you fetch an individual resource, like a specific repository, the response will typically include all attributes for that resource. This is the "detailed" representation of the resource.
When you fetch a list of resources, like a list of multiple repositories, the response will only include a subset of the attributes for each resource. This is the "summary" representation of the resource.
Note that authorization sometimes influences the amount of detail included in a representation.

The reason for this is because some attributes are computationally expensive for the API to provide, so GitHub excludes those attributes from the summary representation. To obtain those attributes, you can fetch the detailed representation.

The documentation provides an example response for each API method. The example response illustrates all attributes that are returned by that method.

Hypermedia
All resources may have one or more *_url properties linking to other resources. These are meant to provide explicit URLs so that proper API clients don't need to construct URLs on their own. It is highly recommended that API clients use these. Doing so will make future upgrades of the API easier for developers. All URLs are expected to be proper RFC 6570 URI templates.

You can then expand these templates using something like the uri_template gem:

>> tmpl = URITemplate.new('/notifications{?since,all,participating}')
>> tmpl.expand
=> "/notifications"

>> tmpl.expand all: 1
=> "/notifications?all=1"

>> tmpl.expand all: 1, participating: 1
=> "/notifications?all=1&participating=1"




Authenticating to the REST API
You can authenticate to the REST API to access more endpoints and have a higher rate limit.

About authentication
Many REST API endpoints require authentication or return additional information if you are authenticated. Additionally, you can make more requests per hour when you are authenticated.

To authenticate your request, you will need to provide an authentication token with the required scopes or permissions. There a few different ways to get a token: You can create a personal access token, generate a token with a GitHub App, or use the built-in GITHUB_TOKEN in a GitHub Actions workflow.

After creating a token, you can authenticate your request by sending the token in the Authorization header of your request. For example, in the following request, replace YOUR-TOKEN with a reference to your token:

curl --request GET \
--url "https://api.github.com/octocat" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN" \
--header "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28"
Note

In most cases, you can use Authorization: Bearer or Authorization: token to pass a token. However, if you are passing a JSON web token (JWT), you must use Authorization: Bearer.

Failed login limit
If you try to use a REST API endpoint without a token or with a token that has insufficient permissions, you will receive a 404 Not Found or 403 Forbidden response. Authenticating with invalid credentials will initially return a 401 Unauthorized response.

After detecting several requests with invalid credentials within a short period, the API will temporarily reject all authentication attempts for that user (including ones with valid credentials) with a 403 Forbidden response. For more information, see Rate limits for the REST API.

Authenticating with a personal access token
If you want to use the GitHub REST API for personal use, you can create a personal access token. If possible, GitHub recommends that you use a fine-grained personal access token instead of a personal access token (classic). For more information about creating a personal access token, see Managing your personal access tokens.

If you are using a fine-grained personal access token, your fine-grained personal access token requires specific permissions in order to access each REST API endpoint. The REST API reference document for each endpoint states whether the endpoint works with fine-grained personal access tokens and states what permissions are required in order for the token to use the endpoint. Some endpoints may require multiple permissions, and some endpoints may require one of multiple permissions. For an overview of which REST API endpoints a fine-grained personal access token can access with each permission, see Permissions required for fine-grained personal access tokens.

If you are using a personal access token (classic), it requires specific scopes in order to access each REST API endpoint. For general guidance about what scopes to choose, see Scopes for OAuth apps.

Personal access tokens and SAML SSO
If you use a personal access token (classic) to access an organization that enforces SAML single sign-on (SSO) for authentication, you will need to authorize your token after creation. Fine-grained personal access tokens are authorized during token creation, before access to the organization is granted. For more information, see Authorizing a personal access token for use with SAML single sign-on.

If you do not authorize your personal access token (classic) for SAML SSO before you try to use it to access a single organization that enforces SAML SSO, you may receive a 404 Not Found or a 403 Forbidden error. If you receive a 403 Forbidden error, the X-GitHub-SSO header will include a URL that you can follow to authorize your token. The URL expires after one hour.

If you do not authorize your personal access token (classic) for SAML SSO before you try to use it to access multiple organizations, the API will not return results from the organizations that require SAML SSO and the X-GitHub-SSO header will indicate the ID of the organizations that require SAML SSO authorization of your personal access token (classic). For example: X-GitHub-SSO: partial-results; organizations=21955855,20582480.

Authenticating with a token generated by an app
If you want to use the API for an organization or on behalf of another user, GitHub recommends that you use a GitHub App. For more information, see About authentication with a GitHub App.

The REST API reference documentation for each endpoint states whether the endpoint works with GitHub Apps and states what permissions are required in order for the app to use the endpoint. Some endpoints may require multiple permissions, and some endpoints may require one of multiple permissions. For an overview of which REST API endpoints a GitHub App can access with each permission, see Permissions required for GitHub Apps.

You can also create an OAuth token with an OAuth app to access the REST API. However, GitHub recommends that you use a GitHub App instead. GitHub Apps allow more control over the access and permission that the app has.

Access tokens created by apps are automatically authorized for SAML SSO.

Using basic authentication
Some REST API endpoints for GitHub Apps and OAuth apps require you to use basic authentication to access the endpoint. You will use the app's client ID as the username and the app's client secret as the password.

For example:

curl --request POST \
--url "https://api.github.com/applications/YOUR_CLIENT_ID/token" \
--user "YOUR_CLIENT_ID:YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
--header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
--header "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
--data '{
  "access_token": "ACCESS_TOKEN_TO_CHECK"
}'
The client ID and client secret are associated with the app, not with the owner of the app or a user who authorized the app. They are used to perform operations on behalf of the app, such as creating access tokens.

If you are the owner of a GitHub App or OAuth app, or if you are an app manager for a GitHub App, you can find the client ID and generate a client secret on the settings page for your app. To navigate to your app's settings page:

In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo.
Navigate to your account settings.
For an app owned by a personal account, click Settings.
For an app owned by an organization:
Click Your organizations.
To the right of the organization, click Settings.
In the left sidebar, click  Developer settings.
In the left sidebar, click GitHub Apps or OAuth apps.
For GitHub Apps, to the right of the GitHub App you want to access, click Edit. For OAuth apps, click the app that you want to access.
Next to Client ID, you will see the client ID for your app.
Next to Client secrets, click Generate a new client secret to generate a client secret for your app.
Authenticating in a GitHub Actions workflow
If you want to use the API in a GitHub Actions workflow, GitHub recommends that you authenticate with the built-in GITHUB_TOKEN instead of creating a token. You can grant permissions to the GITHUB_TOKEN with the permissions key. For more information, see Automatic token authentication.

If this is not possible, you can store your token as a secret and use the name of your secret in your GitHub Actions workflow. For more information about secrets, see Using secrets in GitHub Actions.

Authenticating in a GitHub Actions workflow using GitHub CLI
To make an authenticated request to the API in a GitHub Actions workflow using GitHub CLI, you can store the value of GITHUB_TOKEN as an environment variable, and use the run keyword to execute the GitHub CLI api subcommand. For more information about the run keyword, see Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions.

In the following example workflow, replace PATH with the path of the endpoint. For more information about the path, see Getting started with the REST API.

jobs:
  use_api:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions: {}
    steps:
      - env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          gh api /PATH
Authenticating in a GitHub Actions workflow using curl
To make an authenticated request to the API in a GitHub Actions workflow using curl, you can store the value of GITHUB_TOKEN as an environment variable, and use the run keyword to execute a curl request to the API. For more information about the run keyword, see Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions.

In the following example workflow, replace PATH with the path of the endpoint. For more information about the path, see Getting started with the REST API.

Authenticating in a GitHub Actions workflow using JavaScript
For an example of how to authenticate in a GitHub Actions workflow using JavaScript, see Scripting with the REST API and JavaScript.

Authenticating with username and password
Authentication with username and password is not supported. If you try to authenticate with user name and password, you will receive a 4xx error.

Avoid polling
You should subscribe to webhook events instead of polling the API for data. This will help your integration stay within the API rate limit. For more information, see Webhooks documentation.

Make authenticated requests
Authenticated requests have a higher primary rate limit than unauthenticated requests. To avoid exceeding the rate limit, you should make authenticated requests. For more information, see Rate limits for the REST API.

Avoid concurrent requests
To avoid exceeding secondary rate limits, you should make requests serially instead of concurrently. To achieve this, you can implement a queue system for requests.

Pause between mutative requests
If you are making a large number of POST, PATCH, PUT, or DELETE requests, wait at least one second between each request. This will help you avoid secondary rate limits.

Handle rate limit errors appropriately
If you receive a rate limit error, you should stop making requests temporarily according to these guidelines:

If the retry-after response header is present, you should not retry your request until after that many seconds has elapsed.
If the x-ratelimit-remaining header is 0, you should not make another request until after the time specified by the x-ratelimit-reset header. The x-ratelimit-reset header is in UTC epoch seconds.
Otherwise, wait for at least one minute before retrying. If your request continues to fail due to a secondary rate limit, wait for an exponentially increasing amount of time between retries, and throw an error after a specific number of retries.
Continuing to make requests while you are rate limited may result in the banning of your integration.

Follow redirects
The GitHub REST API uses HTTP redirection where appropriate. You should assume that any request may result in a redirection. Receiving an HTTP redirection is not an error, and you should follow the redirect.

A 301 status code indicates permanent redirection. You should repeat your request to the URL specified by the location header. Additionally, you should update your code to use this URL for future requests.

A 302 or 307 status code indicates temporary redirection. You should repeat your request to the URL specified by the location header. However, you should not update your code to use this URL for future requests.

Other redirection status codes may be used in accordance with HTTP specifications.

Do not manually parse URLs
Many API endpoints return URL values for fields in the response body. You should not try to parse these URLs or to predict the structure of future URLs. This can cause your integration to break if GitHub changes the structure of the URL in the future. Instead, you should look for a field that contains the information that you need. For example, the endpoint to create an issue returns an html_url field with a value like https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/issues/1347 and a number field with a value like 1347. If you need to know the number of the issue, use the number field instead of parsing the html_url field.

Similarly, you should not try to manually construct pagination queries. Instead, you should use the link headers to determine what pages of results you can request. For more information, see Using pagination in the REST API.

Use conditional requests if appropriate
Most endpoints return an etag header, and many endpoints return a last-modified header. You can use the values of these headers to make conditional GET requests. If the response has not changed, you will receive a 304 Not Modified response. Making a conditional request does not count against your primary rate limit if a 304 response is returned.

For example, if a previous request returned an etag header value of 644b5b0155e6404a9cc4bd9d8b1ae730, you can use the if-none-match header in a future request:

curl https://api.github.com/meta --include --header 'if-none-match: "644b5b0155e6404a9cc4bd9d8b1ae730"'
For example, if a previous request returned a last-modified header value of Wed, 25 Oct 2023 19:17:59 GMT, you can use the if-modified-since header in a future request:

curl https://api.github.com/repos/github/docs --include --header 'if-modified-since: Wed, 25 Oct 2023 19:17:59 GMT'
Conditional requests for unsafe methods, such as POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE are not supported unless otherwise noted in the documentation for a specific endpoint.

Do not ignore errors
You should not ignore repeated 4xx and 5xx error codes. Instead, you should ensure that you are correctly interacting with the API. For example, if an endpoint requests a string and you are passing it a numeric value, you will receive a validation error. Similarly, attempting to access an unauthorized or nonexistent endpoint will result in a 4xx error.

Intentionally ignoring repeated validation errors may result in the suspension of your app for abuse.

Rate limit errors
GitHub enforces rate limits to ensure that the API stays available for all users. For more information, see Rate limits for the REST API.

If you exceed your primary rate limit, you will receive a 403 Forbidden or 429 Too Many Requests  response, and the x-ratelimit-remaining header will be 0. If you exceed a secondary rate limit, you will receive a 403 Forbidden or 429 Too Many Requests  response and an error message that indicates that you exceeded a secondary rate limit.

If you receive a rate limit error, you should stop making requests temporarily according to these guidelines:

If the retry-after response header is present, you should not retry your request until after that many seconds has elapsed.
If the x-ratelimit-remaining header is 0, you should not make another request until after the time specified by the x-ratelimit-reset header. The x-ratelimit-reset header is in UTC epoch seconds.
Otherwise, wait for at least one minute before retrying. If your request continues to fail due to a secondary rate limit, wait for an exponentially increasing amount of time between retries, and throw an error after a specific number of retries.
Continuing to make requests while you are rate limited may result in the banning of your integration.

For more information about how to avoid exceeding the rate limits, see Best practices for using the REST API.

404 Not Found for an existing resource
If you make a request to access a private resource and your request isn't properly authenticated, you will receive a 404 Not Found response. GitHub uses a 404 Not Found response instead of a 403 Forbidden response to avoid confirming the existence of private repositories.

If you get a 404 Not Found response when you know that the resource that you are requesting exists, you should check your authentication. For example:

If you are using a personal access token (classic), you should ensure that:
The token has the scopes that are required to use the endpoint. For more information, see Scopes for OAuth apps and Managing your personal access tokens.
The owner of the token has any permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For example, if an endpoint can only be used by organization owners, only users that are owners of the affected organization can use the endpoint.
The token has not been expired or revoked. For more information, see Token expiration and revocation.
If you are using a fine-grained personal access token, you should ensure that:
The token has the permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For more information about the required permissions, see the documentation for the endpoint.
The resource owner that was specified for the token matches the owner of the resource that the endpoint will affect. For more information, see Managing your personal access tokens.
The token has access to any private repositories that the endpoint will affect. For more information, see Managing your personal access tokens.
The owner of the token has any permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For example, if an endpoint can only be used by organization owners, only users that are owners of the affected organization can use the endpoint.
The token has not been expired or revoked. For more information, see Token expiration and revocation.
If you are using a GitHub App installation access token, you should ensure that:
The GitHub App has the permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For more information about the required permissions, see the documentation for the endpoint.
The endpoint is only affecting resources owned by the account where the GitHub App is installed.
The GitHub App has access to any repositories that the endpoint will affect.
The token has not been expired or revoked. For more information, see Token expiration and revocation.
If you are using a GitHub App user access token, you should ensure that:
The GitHub App has the permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For more information about the required permissions, see the documentation for the endpoint.
The user that authorized the token has any permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For example, if an endpoint can only be used by organization owners, only users that are owners of the affected organization can use the endpoint.
The GitHub App has access to any repositories that the endpoint will affect.
The user has access to any repositories that the endpoint will affect.
The user has approved any updated permissions for your GitHub App. For more information, see Approving updated permissions for a GitHub App.
If you are using an OAuth app user access token, you should ensure that:
The token has the scopes that are required to use the endpoint. For more information, see Scopes for OAuth apps.
The user that authorized the token has any permissions that are required to use the endpoint. For example, if an endpoint can only be used by organization owners, only users that are owners of the affected organization can use the endpoint.
The organization has not blocked OAuth app access, if you are using an endpoint that will affect resources owned by an organization. App owners cannot see whether their app is blocked, but they can instruct users of the app to check this. For more information, see About OAuth app access restrictions.
The token has not been expired or revoked. For more information, see Token expiration and revocation.
If you are using GITHUB_TOKEN in a GitHub Actions workflow, you should ensure that:
The endpoint is only affecting resources owned by the repository where the workflow is running. If you need to access resources outside of that repository, such as resources owned by an organization or resources owned by another repository, you should use a personal access token or an access token for a GitHub App.
For more information about authentication, see Authenticating to the REST API.

You should also check for typos in your URL. For example, adding a trailing slash to the endpoint will result in a 404 Not Found. You can refer to the reference documentation for the endpoint to confirm that you have the correct URL.

Additionally, any path parameters must be URL encoded. For example, any slashes in the parameter value must be replaced with %2F. If you don't properly encode any slashes in the parameter name, the endpoint URL will be misinterpreted.

Missing results
Most endpoints that return a list of resources support pagination. For most of these endpoints, only the first 30 resources are returned by default. In order to see all of the resources, you need to paginate through the results. For more information, see Using pagination in the REST API.

If you are using pagination correctly and still do not see all of the results that you expect, you should confirm that the authentication credentials that you used have access to all of the expected resources. For example, if you are using a GitHub App installation access token, if the installation was only granted access to a subset of repositories in an organization, any request for all repositories in that organization will return only the repositories that the app installation can access.

Requires authentication when using basic authentication
Basic authentication with your username and password is not supported. Instead, you should use a personal access token or an access token for a GitHub App or OAuth app. For more information, see Authenticating to the REST API.

Timeouts
If GitHub takes more than 10 seconds to process an API request, GitHub will terminate the request and you will receive a timeout response and a "Server Error" message.

GitHub reserves the right to change the timeout window to protect the speed and reliability of the API.

You can check the status of the REST API at githubstatus.com to determine whether the timeout is due to a problem with the API. You can also try to simplify your request or try your request later. For example, if you are requesting 100 items on a page, you can try requesting fewer items.

Resource not accessible
If you are using a GitHub App or fine-grained personal access token and you receive a "Resource not accessible by integration" or "Resource not accessible by personal access token" error, then your token has insufficient permissions. For more information about the required permissions, see the documentation for the endpoint.

You can use the X-Accepted-GitHub-Permissions header to identify the permissions that are required to access the REST API endpoint.

The value of the X-Accepted-GitHub-Permissions header is a comma separated list of the permissions that are required to use the endpoint. Occasionally, you can choose from multiple permission sets. In these cases, multiple comma-separated lists will be separated by a semicolon.

For example:

X-Accepted-GitHub-Permissions: contents=read means that your GitHub App or fine-grained personal access token needs read access to the contents permission.
X-Accepted-GitHub-Permissions: pull_requests=write,contents=read means that your GitHub App or fine-grained personal access token needs write access to the pull request permission and read access to the contents permission.
X-Accepted-GitHub-Permissions: pull_requests=read,contents=read; issues=read,contents=read means that your GitHub App or fine-grained personal access token needs either read access to the pull request permission and read access to the contents permission, or read access to the issues permission and read access to the contents permission.
Problems parsing JSON
If you send invalid JSON in the request body, you may receive a 400 Bad Request response and a "Problems parsing JSON" error message. You can use a linter or JSON validator to help you identify errors in your JSON.

Body should be a JSON object
If the endpoint expects a JSON object and you do not format your request body as a JSON object, you may receive a 400 Bad Request response and a "Body should be a JSON object" error message.

Invalid request
If you omit required parameters or you use the wrong type for a parameter, you may receive a 422 Unprocessable Entity response and an "Invalid request" error message. For example, you will get this error if you specify a parameter value as an array but the endpoint is expecting a string. You can refer to the reference documentation for the endpoint to verify that you are using the correct parameter types and that you are including all of the required parameters.

Validation Failed
If your request could not be processed, you may receive a 422 Unprocessable Entity response and a "Validation Failed" error message. The response body will include an errors property, which includes a code property to help you diagnose the problem.

Code	Description
missing	A resource does not exist.
missing_field	A parameter that was required was not specified. Review the documentation for the endpoint to see what parameters are required.
invalid	The formatting of a parameter is invalid. Review the endpoint documentation for more specific information.
already_exists	Another resource has the same value as one of your parameters. This can happen in resources that must have some unique key (such as label names).
unprocessable	The parameters that were provided were invalid.
custom	Refer to the message property to diagnose the error.
Not a supported version
You should use the X-GitHub-Api-Version header to specify an API version. For example:

curl --header "X-GitHub-Api-Version:2022-11-28" https://api.github.com/zen
If you specify a version that does not exist, you will receive a 400 Bad Request error and a message about the version not being supported.

For more information, see API Versions.

User agent required
Requests without a valid User-Agent header will be rejected. You should use your username or the name of your application for the User-Agent value.

curl sends a valid User-Agent header by default.

Other errors
If you observe an error that is not addressed here, you should refer to the error message that the API gives you. Most error messages will provide a clue about what is wrong and a link to relevant documentation.

If you observe unexpected failures, you can use githubstatus.com or the GitHub status API to check for incidents affecting the API.

REST API endpoints for issues
Use the REST API to manage issues and pull requests.

List issues assigned to the authenticated user
List issues assigned to the authenticated user across all visible repositories including owned repositories, member repositories, and organization repositories. You can use the filter query parameter to fetch issues that are not necessarily assigned to you.

Note

GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by the pull_request key. Be aware that the id of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an issue id. To find out the pull request id, use the "List pull requests" endpoint.

This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "Media types."

application/vnd.github.raw+json: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include body. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
application/vnd.github.text+json: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include body_text.
application/vnd.github.html+json: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include body_html.
application/vnd.github.full+json: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include body, body_text, and body_html.
Fine-grained access tokens for "List issues assigned to the authenticated user"
This endpoint works with the following fine-grained token types:

GitHub App user access tokens
Fine-grained personal access tokens
The fine-grained token does not require any permissions.

List organization issues assigned to the authenticated user
List issues in an organization assigned to the authenticated user.

Note

GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by the pull_request key. Be aware that the id of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an issue id. To find out the pull request id, use the "List pull requests" endpoint.

This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "Media types."

application/vnd.github.raw+json: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include body. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
application/vnd.github.text+json: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include body_text.
application/vnd.github.html+json: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include body_html.
application/vnd.github.full+json: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include body, body_text, and body_html.
Fine-grained access tokens for "List organization issues assigned to the authenticated user"

List repository issues
List issues in a repository. Only open issues will be listed.

Note

GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by the pull_request key. Be aware that the id of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an issue id. To find out the pull request id, use the "List pull requests" endpoint.

This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "Media types."

application/vnd.github.raw+json: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include body. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
application/vnd.github.text+json: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include body_text.
application/vnd.github.html+json: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include body_html.
application/vnd.github.full+json: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include body, body_text, and body_html.
Fine-grained access tokens for "List repository issues"
This endpoint works with the following fine-grained token types:

GitHub App user access tokens

Get an issue
The API returns a 301 Moved Permanently status if the issue was transferred to another repository. If the issue was transferred to or deleted from a repository where the authenticated user lacks read access, the API returns a 404 Not Found status. If the issue was deleted from a repository where the authenticated user has read access, the API returns a 410 Gone status. To receive webhook events for transferred and deleted issues, subscribe to the issues webhook.

Note

GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by the pull_request key. Be aware that the id of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an issue id. To find out the pull request id, use the "List pull requests" endpoint.

This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "Media types."

application/vnd.github.raw+json: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include body. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
application/vnd.github.text+json: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include body_text.
application/vnd.github.html+json: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include body_html.
application/vnd.github.full+json: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include body, body_text, and body_html.
Fine-grained access tokens for "Get an issue"
This endpoint works with the following fine-grained token types:

GitHub App user access tokens

List user account issues assigned to the authenticated user
List issues across owned and member repositories assigned to the authenticated user.

Note

GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by the pull_request key. Be aware that the id of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an issue id. To find out the pull request id, use the "List pull requests" endpoint.

This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "Media types."

application/vnd.github.raw+json: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include body. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
application/vnd.github.text+json: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include body_text.
application/vnd.github.html+json: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include body_html.
application/vnd.github.full+json: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include body, body_text, and body_html.

Create a pull request
Draft pull requests are available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, GitHub Pro, and legacy per-repository billing plans, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Team and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see GitHub's products in the GitHub Help documentation.

To open or update a pull request in a public repository, you must have write access to the head or the source branch. For organization-owned repositories, you must be a member of the organization that owns the repository to open or update a pull request.

This endpoint triggers notifications. Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary rate limiting. For more information, see "Rate limits for the API" and "Best practices for using the REST API."

This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "Media types."

application/vnd.github.raw+json: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include body. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
application/vnd.github.text+json: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include body_text.
application/vnd.github.html+json: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include body_html.
application/vnd.github.full+json: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include body, body_text, and body_html.

Get a pull request
Draft pull requests are available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, GitHub Pro, and legacy per-repository billing plans, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Team and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see GitHub's products in the GitHub Help documentation.

Lists details of a pull request by providing its number.

When you get, create, or edit a pull request, GitHub creates a merge commit to test whether the pull request can be automatically merged into the base branch. This test commit is not added to the base branch or the head branch. You can review the status of the test commit using the mergeable key. For more information, see "Checking mergeability of pull requests".

The value of the mergeable attribute can be true, false, or null. If the value is null, then GitHub has started a background job to compute the mergeability. After giving the job time to complete, resubmit the request. When the job finishes, you will see a non-null value for the mergeable attribute in the response. If mergeable is true, then merge_commit_sha will be the SHA of the test merge commit.

The value of the merge_commit_sha attribute changes depending on the state of the pull request. Before merging a pull request, the merge_commit_sha attribute holds the SHA of the test merge commit. After merging a pull request, the merge_commit_sha attribute changes depending on how you merged the pull request:

If merged as a merge commit, merge_commit_sha represents the SHA of the merge commit.
If merged via a squash, merge_commit_sha represents the SHA of the squashed commit on the base branch.
If rebased, merge_commit_sha represents the commit that the base branch was updated to.
